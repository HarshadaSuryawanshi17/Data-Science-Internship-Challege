Challenge Question Answer

Question: What algorithm, machine learning, or AI approaches would you use to find anomalies in log data? And why do you think that approach is a good approach?

Answer:
Algorithm Choice: Isolation Forest
Reason: The Isolation Forest algorithm is effective for anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets. It isolates observations by randomly selecting features and splitting values, which helps in identifying rare events or anomalies without needing labeled data. It is computationally efficient and works well with large datasets.
